=====================

This is the text for an open source business plan for a "social archive site." With this platform, people who are interested in passing down their digital assets to future generations will be able to create community-run social archive sites.

The plan is currently being transitioned from a graduate school project to a document that can provide a starting place for others interested in community-run social archive sites. I'd love to have your help improving the ideas here.

Digital Storymakers Foundation was incorporated as a North Carolina nonprofit in March 2011. Storymakers was founded to find sustainable ways for communities to make, preserve, and own their digital stories. For more information about this project, see www.digitalstorymakers.org.
