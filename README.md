=====================

This text is an open source business plan for social archive sites.

Digital Storymakers Foundation was incorporated as a North Carolina nonprofit in March 2011. Storymakers was founded to help communities make, preserve, and own their digital stories. With this open-source platform, people who are interested in passing down their digital assets to future generations will be able to easily create community-run “social archive sites.”
